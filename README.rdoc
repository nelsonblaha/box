== Box is an voteable email repository.
The goal for Box is to have:
1. A more creative name
2. A repository where a group (think an office), which uses a lot of template emails, can add their commonly used emails.
3. The emails can then be voted on by all group users, with the best rising to the top.
4. Users will have stored signatures.
5. With one click on an email in the repository, the email, and the user's signature will be copied to the clipboard, ready for pasting. 
6. Groups are able to keep the group repository private and invite-only to users.
7. Users have secure logins.
8. This is most likely useful for customer-service type settings, where a large amount of similar answers are sent to clients. But it could be used for any type of text.
